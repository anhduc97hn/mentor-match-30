# ✨ Mentor Match 3.0

## 🚧 Work In Progress: The Next Generation

This repository houses the source code for **Version 3** of my personal application, **Mentor Match**.

This major re-write is focused on building a scalable, high-performance platform using **Next.js**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals for v3

The primary goal of this iteration is to deliver a complete, modern application with a clean, efficient architecture.

* **Complete Overhaul:** A full redesign and rebuild from the ground up to improve speed and maintainability.
* **API Development:** Currently focused on building a robust, dedicated **API layer** to handle all data and business logic. This will serve the Next.js frontend.
* **Modern Stack:** Transitioning to a unified **Next.js** framework to leverage server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes for a superior developer and user experience.
